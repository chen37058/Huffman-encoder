We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many months of struggle and suffering. You ask, what is our policy? 
You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs¡ªvictory in spite of all terrors¡ªvictory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival. 
Let that be realized. No survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge, the impulse of the ages, that mankind shall move forward toward his goal. I take up my task in light heart and hope. 
I feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among men. I feel entitled at this juncture, at this time, to claim the aid of all and to say, ¡°Come then, let us go forward together with our united strength.¡±
